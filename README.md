# multipools

Supplementary material for "Rapid, Large-Scale, and Effective Detection of COVID-19 Via Non-Adaptive Testing" by Matthias Taeufer.
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.028431

The file function_multipool_matrix.py defines a function generating matrices for pooled testing with prime pool sizes, based on the Shifted Transversal Design by Nicolas Thierry-Mieg in https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-7-28

The file simulation.py runs a simulation to compare the experimental to the theoretical false negative rate calculated in the preprint.
